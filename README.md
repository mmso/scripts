# Collection of scripts

*   __l colorizes your ls output and calculates relative time.__

    A simple perl script which doesn't rely on any libraries. Can alternate views with:

        --pf    permissions, file
        --psf   permissions, size, file
        --tpf   time, permissions, file
        --tpsf  time, permissions, size, file (default)
        --ptsf  permissions, time, size, file

    An improved version of the script by Magnus Woldrich can be found here:
    __ls++__ <https://github.com/trapd00r/ls-->

* __unicode lists some special characters, mostly for testing the terminal__
